	    <h2>Java Tutorial</h2>

            <p>Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.</p>
            <h3>What is Java</h3>
            <p>Java is a programming language and a platform.<br>
                Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
           <br> Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>

            <h3>Application</h3>
            <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
                <li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
                <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
                <li>Mobile</li>
                <li>Embedded System</li>
                <li>Games </li>
                <li>Smart Card, etc.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Types of Java Applications</h3>
            <p>There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Standalone Application</h4>
                    <p>Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Web Application</h4>
                    <p>An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Mobile Application</h4>
                    <p>An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
